[First Report - DS.pdf](https://github.com/Jokuchh/Digital-Signal-Processing/files/8840778/First.Report.-.DS.pdf)

In the First Report, i was focusing on the following point : Four assignments where i had to analyze recordings and other real-life data with the methods and theory that i learn on Lectures from Digital-Signal-Processing
So, the purpose of this work was to apply our theoretical knowledge in the field of signal processing into real life cases.

[Second Report - DS.pdf](https://github.com/Jokuchh/Digital-Signal-Processing/files/8840777/Second.Report.-.DS.pdf)

In the Second Report, i supposed to do the tutorial which gives me a brief introduction to signal filtering.
