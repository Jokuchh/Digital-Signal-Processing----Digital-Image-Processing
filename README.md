# Digital-Signal-Processing
Creation and usage of various filters for signals

[First Report - DS.pdf](https://github.com/Jokuchh/Digital-Signal-Processing/files/8840778/First.Report.-.DS.pdf)

In this Lab, we will be focusing on the following point:
Four assignments where we have to analyze recordings and other real-life data
with the methods and theory that we learn in Lectures 1 to 3.
So, the purpose of this Lab is to apply our theoretical knowledge in the field of
signal processing into real life cases.

[Second Report - DS.pdf](https://github.com/Jokuchh/Digital-Signal-Processing/files/8840777/Second.Report.-.DS.pdf)

In this lab, we were supposed to do the tutorial which gives us a brief
introduction to signal filtering. Then, several assignments were done where we
had to analyze our recorded data and other real-life data with the methods and
theory that we learnt in Lectures 1 to 7.
